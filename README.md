CCL Poster Template
===================

My Beamer template for posters with the ND and CCL styling.
I included two posters (`jx.tex` and `shrinkwrap.tex`) as examples.
They are a little messy from fine-tuning the styling and such.
I also included a stripped-down example (`sample.tex`) showing the basic pieces.
**This is probably where you want to start.**

You should be able to type `make` to build the samples,
and `make clean` to clean up.
The directories just contain the figures used in the examples,
so you can just delete all that and start from `sample.tex`.
